### Subsets

gunlaws_mass_shootings.csv consists data from mass_shootings_per_year.csv and gunlaws_opinions.csv

mass_shootings_per_year.csv consists data from mj-198202016-US-mass-shootings.csv

gunlaw_opinion.csv consists data from tdgunlaw.csv

age_frequency.csv consists data from tdgunlaw.csv

tdgunlaw.csv consists data from GSS7214_R6a.sav


### Process

* Step1: Run spss-conreducer.py to read GSS7214_R6a.csv file and input the variables, year, id, sex, race, age, region, gunlaw. Give a name to the file input 'yes' for complete cases. In this case, it creates tdgunlaw.csv

* Step2: The script gunlaw-cript.py uses tdgunlaw.csv to calculate the total of respondents per year, the average age of the respondents per year, the proportion of answers in favor of gun permits per year, the average age of respondents in favor, the proportion of answers in opposition to gun permits per year, the average age of respondents in opposition. It creates a new file: gunlaw_opinion.csv and age_frequency.csv

* Step3: Use mass_shootings.py script to read mj-1982-2016-US-mass-shootings.csv and calculate how many mass shoots per year. it creates mass_shootings_per_year.csv

* Step4: the script twodatasets.py will take mass_shootings_per_year.csv and gunlaw_opinion.csv and it merges both files returning gunlaws_mass_shootings.csv
